The compiler does static checking in two phases:
 1. regular type checking
 2. label checking

Both of these are done using the SHErrLoc system, by writing out
constraints to files that are handed to SHErrLoc. SHErrLoc does type
checking, type inference, and error localization. Static errors reported
to the user come from the constraints passed to SHErrLoc.
