<h1>SCIF: Smart Contract Information Flow</h1>
<p>
SCIF is a new programming language for building compositionally secure smart
contracts. Smart contracts implemented in SCIF are checked by the compiler for
their security properties before they are deployed. SCIF is especially designed
to support building secure systems in which multiple smart contracts interact.
It detects and prevents common security vulnerabilities such as use of untrusted
information, reentrancy attacks, and confused deputy attacks.</p>
<p>
The core security mechanism of SCIF is static information flow
checking, applied to integrity policies that can be used to annotate
code. State-of-the-art compile-time diagnosis tools give programmers
accurate feedback about where security bugs exist in their code. The
SCIF runtime system also supports dynamic trust management so that
security and trust policies can evolve securely even after contracts
are deployed. A precise run-time lock mechanism prevents reentrancy
vulnerabilities, and confused deputy attacks are prevented by run-time
mechanisms to prevent type confusion.
