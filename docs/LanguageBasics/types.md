# Types

SCIF is statically typed, meaning that the type of each variable and method need to be specified at compile time. However, SCIF provides inference mechanisms to infer labels for programmer's convinience.

## Primitive types

* `bool`: Boolean type where the possible values are `true` and `false`.
* `uint`: Unsigned integer type where the possible values are between 0 and 2^256 - 1.
* `byte`: Byte type where the possible values are between 0 and 2^8 - 1.
